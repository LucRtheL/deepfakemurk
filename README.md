## What is this?
```
murk - "m√ªrk": noun
	1. To re-enroll a previously shimmered chromebook.

The Skid Dictionary of the English Language, 7th Edition.
```
`fakemurk` is a tool intended for use on an already unenrolled chromebook. It will allow you to re-enroll, making your chromebook appear identical to an enrolled one, except keep developer mode, and even boot off a linux USB, all while ***tricking chromeOS into thinking you're in verified mode***, so your chromebook will not show up any different from the hundreds of other chromebooks in your enterprise's google admin console.

## Why should I use this?
We're going to assume that if you're reading this, there's a 99% chance you're either a student, (or hey maybe even a sysadmin for a school), and you've probably recently used sh1mmer on your chromebook.

Now, we're also going to go out on a limb here and say that if you're a student, there's a good chance your local sysadmin does not want you to be unenrolling, and if you have a more nosy one, they're gonna try and find people unenrolling.
There's also a good chance you didn't properly cover your tracks, and certain logs in the google admin console can reveal you.
Your school might also require the use of kiosk apps for tests, and you might not know how to spoof them.
You also might not know your school's wifi password, but still want to be free of restrictions and spying at home

The list goes on. 

## How do I use this??
First, you want to already have an unenrolled chromebook in devmode. You also should have prepared a USB with the linux distro of your choice (or maybe chromeos flex). [link to catakangs video](here) 
  
Next, head over to chrome-untrusted://crosh, type `shell` and then run the bash script as root.

Do everything it tells you to, and after the final powerwash, you will automatically re-enroll.
Thats it!

## How it works

fucky crossystem.sh stuff it's reallly cool
